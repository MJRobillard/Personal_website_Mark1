                <h2>Spotify Car Radio Integration</h2>
                <h4>My old car had a personal problem with Spotify but had no problem playing music from my iTunes. So using some libraries I found on GitHub, I wrote this to search for the songs in a playlist on Spotify in YouTube, download the audio and metadata, and put them into my iTunes.</h4>

                <h2>Cal RSF Weight Room Optimization</h2>
                <h4>I love when the weight room at the gym is nearly empty. The local gym posts a meter online showing how full it is, but they only offer a live update. So to find the best time to go to the gym, I built a web scraper using Selenium and Beautiful Soup to record live updates in a CSV every five minutes as a background process. Now I just have to let the program collect the data.</h4>

                <h4>Those hiring and new students have little reference about how prestigious a tech club at UC Berkeley is. Sure they can look at the club's website, but it's hard to compare two different clubs. This project aims to solve that problem with a comprehensive website with ranking methodology and data of the clubs here at Cal.</h4>
